// output can be written in three different ways, (1) document.write(variable), we can see it on the body of the browser  

alert(cost)
// (2) alert(varibale),it generates alert, it is used for debugging

console.log(value)
// mmost frequently used (3) console.log(varibale), it can be seen in inspect console ... any error can be seen there ... also it can be edited/typed ... we can write codes on console also ... we can see our entire code in resources ... etc.

// anything written between single quotation (' ') or double quotation (" ") is called a string type data ... even if we store number within quotations, number will  be defined as string ...  we use number for arithmetic operator
